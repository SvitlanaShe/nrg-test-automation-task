# QA Engineer Task
> Outfittery - Team NRG

Hello! If you're looking at this repository, it means you're considering work at Outfittery, and that's awesome! Thank you for considering working with us!

So, this repository is nothing but a simple boilerplate to help you setting up your front-end work environment for the task. It gives you access to pre-defined colors, directives, components, etc, that you might need during your task, besides showing you a bit of what we use at Outfittery.

There certainly is a lot of room for improvement. During your coding task, if you find anything that needs improvement, feel free to do it. If you could let us know about such improvements, it'd actually be awesome, as that'd allow us to continuously improve and hire more awesome people like yourself :)
